---  Here's my progress for understanding how to work with node using **LinkedIn Learning**:


# Learning node.js Course

* Understanding what node is, it's benefits and asynchronouse tasks and callbacks
* Written my own module, managed third-party packages with npm and create package.json files
* Have read, accessed and written to files using node
* Explored frameworks using Express and Socket.io
* Built a demo app that uses GET and POST messaging service. Had connected it to Socket.io. Have also sent information to the **Postman** program. 
* Had set up **MongoDB Atlas** and saved data (id,username) using the Mongoose package.
* Have worked and tested asynchronouse code using nested callbacks, promises and async/await. Was also able to filter words and not have them appear in database collections.
* I've been able to work with asynchronouse Try/Catch along with "trow" to troubleshoot errors. Also added the finally function.
* I was lectured on new methods on how to work with Visual Code Studio using the debugger tool. 
* I've installed and tested codes using **jasmine**. Worked on specs and tried various tests.
* I've been introduced to "test first development" and have been able to target specific user messages from the database through the server. 

# Node.js Essential Training Course

* Have worked with global objects and global processes.  Used flags to locate indexes in arrays. Also used flags to obtain values.
* Was able to create a small questions/answers application on JavaScript with asynchronous code that involved arrays, incrementor, conditional statements and javascript template literals.
* Worked with timing functions and have created seconds delay on the terminal.
