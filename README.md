# Learning node.js



Here's my progress of what I have learned so far with LinkedIn **Learning Node.js** course. I've taken the time to try and really understand each lecture. Here are the exercises I've been able to work with:


* Understanding what node is, it's benefits and asynchronouse tasks and callbacks
* Written my own module, managed third-party packages with npm and create package.json files
* Have read, accessed and written to files using node
* Explored frameworks using Express and Socket.io
* Built a demo app that uses GET and POST messaging service. Had connected it to Socket.io. Have also sent information to the **Postman** program. 
* Learned about different databases. Had set up **MongoDB** through MongoDB Atlas and saved data using the Mongoose package.
* Have worked and tested asynchronouse code using nested callbacks, promises and async/await. Was also able to filter words and not have them appear in database collections.
* I've been able to work with Try/Catch functionality along with trow to troubleshoot errors. Also added the finally function.
* I was lectured on new methods on how to work with Visual Code Studio using the debugger tool. 
* I've installed and tested codes using **jasmine**. Worked on specs and tried various tests.
* I've been introduced to "test first development" and have been able to target specific user messages from the database through the server.
