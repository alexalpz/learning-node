Also added the finally function.
- I was lectured on new methods on how to work with Visual Code Studio using the debugger tool.

- Worked with timing functions, arrow functions and have created seconds delay on the terminal. 
- I was lectured on core modules such as **path, util and V8**. 
- Created functions using readline module and made a small demo in the console that asked questions after a user input (answer) has been entered.
- Have worked on importing and exporting modules. How I can call functions and shortcuts.
- Created events using the events module. Used a custom event emitter. Have worked with listeners to handle multiple events. 
- Lectured on async and syn file reading.
