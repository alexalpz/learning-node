- Understanding what node is, it's benefits and asynchronouse tasks and callbacks
- Written my own module, managed third-party packages with npm and create package.json files
- Have read, accessed and written to files using node
- Explored frameworks using Express and Socket.io

- Have worked and tested asynchronouse code using nested callbacks, promises and async/await. Was also able to filter words and not have them appear in database collections.- I've been able to work with asynchronouse Try/Catch along with "trow" to troubleshoot errors. Also added the finally function.
- I was lectured on new methods on how to work with Visual Code Studio using the debugger tool. 
- I've installed and tested codes using **jasmine**. Worked on specs and tried various tests.

## Node.js Essential Training Course

- Have worked with global objects and global processes.  Used flags to locate indexes and values in arrays. 
- Was able to create a small questions/answers application on JavaScript with asynchronous code (using standard input/output objects)  conditional statements and javascript template literals.
- Used argument variables(.argv) and collected info when loading terminal
- Worked with timing functions, arrow functions and have created seconds delay on the terminal. 
- I was lectured on core modules such as **path, util and V8**. 
- Created functions using readline module and made a small demo in the console that asked questions after a user input (answer) has been entered.
- Have worked on importing and exporting modules. How I can call functions and shortcuts.
- Created events using the events module. Used a custom event emitter. Have worked with listeners to handle multiple events. 
- Lectured on async and syn file reading.
- Have worked on reading text and image files. 
- Learned how to write, move and remove files using asynchronouse rename function. Asynchronouse need callbacks. 
- Learned how to write, move and remove directories using asynchronouse rename function.
- Stream interface to read and write data through streams. Used pipe function to rewrite files. 
- Creating child process with exec and spawn
