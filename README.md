# Learning node.js



Here's my progress of what I have learned so far with the LinkedIn Learning node.js course. I've taken the time to try and really understand each lecture. Here are the exercises I've been able to work with:


* Understanding what node is, it's benefits and asynchronouse tasks and callbacks
* Written my own module, managed third-party packages with npm and create package.json files
* Have read, accessed and written to files
* Explored frameworks using Express and Socket.io
* Built a demo app that uses GET and POST messaging service. Had connected it to Socket.io. Have also sent and read data to the **Postman** software. 
* Learned about different databases. Had set up **MongoDB** through MongoDB Atlas and saved data using the Mongoose package.
* Have worked and tested asynchronouse code using nested callbacks, promises and async/await. Was also able to filter words and not have them appear in database collections.
* I've been able to work with Try/Catch functionality along with trow to troubleshoot errors. I have also added the Finally function as the last output. 
* I was lectured on new methods on how to work with Visual Code Studio using the debugger tool. 
* I've installed and tested codes using **jasmine**. Did a demo test for a number calculation and one to test if status code is 200 or not. 
* I've been introduced to test first development and have been able to target specific user messages through the server while also testing outputs with jasmine.
