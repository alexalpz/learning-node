# Learning node.js



Here's my progress of what I have learned so far with the LinkedIn Learning node.js course. I've taken the time to try and really understand each lecture. I look at indivial codes and question what it's purpose is and why I need it. I've been able to work with a ton of exercises and have gained some better insight as to how to use node.js. Here's topics I've been able to work with. 


* Understanding what node is, it's benefits and asynchronouse tasks and callbacks
* Written my own module, managed third-party packages with npm and create package.json files
* Have read, accessed and written to files
* Explored frameworks using Express and Socket.io
* Built a demo app that uses GET and POST messaging service. Had connected it to Socket.io. Have also sent and read data to the Postman software. 
* Learned about different databases. Had set up MongoDB through MongoDB Atlas and saved data using the Mongoose package.
* Have worked and tested asynchronouse code using nested callbacks, promises and async/await. Was also able to filter words and not have them appear in database collections.
* I've been able to work with Try/Catch functionality along with trow to troubleshoot errors. I have also added the Finally function as the last output.
